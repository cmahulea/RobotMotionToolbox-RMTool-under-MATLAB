2 rob.
a) Full tr_sys: aprox. 200 secs.
Model of a robot (full transition system) - has 54 states

Team model (global) - full transition system - has 2916 states

Time spent for creating it: 19.3029 secs
Buchi automaton has 6 states;

Product automaton has 17496 states;

Time spent for creating it: 3.71846 secs

Time for finding accepted run: 178.972 secs


b) Tg reduced by permutations (as reachability):
Model of a robot (full transition system) has 54 states

Team model (global) - non-reduced - has 2916 states and it was created in 18.8071 secs
