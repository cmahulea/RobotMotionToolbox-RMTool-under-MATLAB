% Marker Size Helper Function to scale size of markers for robots with figure window
% Input: robotarium class instance
function marker_size = determine_robot_marker_size(robotarium_instance)

% Get the size of the robotarium figure window in pixels
curunits = get(robotarium_instance.figure_handle, 'Units');
set(robotarium_instance.figure_handle, 'Units', 'Pixels');
cursize = get(robotarium_instance.figure_handle, 'Position');
set(robotarium_instance.figure_handle, 'Units', curunits);

% Determine the ratio of the robot size to the x-axis (the axis are
% normalized so you could do this with y and figure height as well).
robot_ratio = (robotarium_instance.robot_diameter + 0.03)/...
    (robotarium_instance.boundaries(2) - robotarium_instance.boundaries(1));

% Determine the marker size in points so it fits the window. cursize(3) is
% the width of the figure window in pixels. (the axis are
% normalized so you could do this with y and figure height as well).
marker_size = cursize(3) * robot_ratio;
