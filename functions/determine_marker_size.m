% Marker Size Helper Function to scale size with figure window
% Input: robotarium instance, desired size of the marker in meters
function marker_size = determine_marker_size(robotarium_instance, marker_size_meters)

% Get the size of the robotarium figure window in pixels
curunits = get(robotarium_instance.figure_handle, 'Units');
set(robotarium_instance.figure_handle, 'Units', 'Pixels');
cursize = get(robotarium_instance.figure_handle, 'Position');
set(robotarium_instance.figure_handle, 'Units', curunits);

% Determine the ratio of the robot size to the x-axis (the axis are
% normalized so you could do this with y and figure height as well).
marker_ratio = (marker_size_meters)/(robotarium_instance.boundaries(2) -...
    robotarium_instance.boundaries(1));

% Determine the marker size in points so it fits the window. cursize(3) is
% the width of the figure window in pixels. (the axis are
% normalized so you could do this with y and figure height as well).
marker_size = cursize(3) * marker_ratio;
